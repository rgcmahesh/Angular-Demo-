Interrogation is express questioning and any words or actions that the police know or should know are likely to elicit an incriminating response. The question here asks you select the best answer that provides the best factual support in favor of the defendant. In other words, if you want this motion to be granted what additional fact would you want to add to help get the motion granted. Answer choice C establishes that the officers created a situation they knew would elicit incriminating information. Arguably there was no interrogation unless the police were trying to elicit a response by using the parents. Now, one of the exceptions to Miranda is statements made to undercover police. The standard is that Miranda warnings are not required if the suspect being questioned is not aware the interrogator is a police officer. But in that particular situation, the supreme court has decided that it&rsquo;s not a custodial interrogation. In this question, the defendant is in police custody.  I hope this helps!

Here is the rule for waiver. Under Rule 12(b), the defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction over the person, insufficiency of process, and insufficiency of service of process must be asserted in a responsive pleading or by motion before a responsive pleading is submitted. A failure to object in accordance with Rule 12 waives the objection. Rule 12(h). Although Rule 12(b) states that a motion asserting one of these defenses must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed, courts have concluded, based on the waiver provision in Rule 12(h)(1), that a motion to dismiss based on one of these defenses may be filed after an answer is filed if the answer pleads one of these defenses. Although not specifically provided for in the Rules, courts have generally allowed a party to amend a motion to dismiss to raise an omitted ground if the party acts promptly and before the court rules on the original motion. The courts reason that ""an amendment made just a few days following the motion is consistent with the spirit of Rule 12(h) and neither prejudices the plaintiff nor burdens the court.""

The answer explanation is referring to the covenant of the brother&rsquo;s promise to pay a percentage of gross receipts from the repair shop, not an enforceable real covenant. As explained in your outline, a covenant linked to real property (i.e. a &ldquo;real covenant&rdquo;) must be in writing, the parties must intend for the rights and duties to run with the land, the covenant must touch and concern the land, and there must be notice and privity. (See pages 86-88 of MBE Real Property Outline). Here, answer choice C is correct because there is no indication that the parties intended the covenant to run with the land. Because the covenant was not created with the requisite intent to run with the land, it is not a valid and enforceable real covenant.

For a real covenant to run with the land, it must be1) in writing 2) intended to run with the land 3) must touch and concern the land 4) give notice of the covenant and 5) have privity of estate (horizontal  vertical for burden; vertical only for benefit).       Horizontal privity exists when there is some simultaneous or shared interest in real property between the original parties to the covenant. You will typically see this in land transfers between parties (grantor/grantee; mortgagor/mortgagee; landlord/tenant) where the covenant is in the same instrument (deed, mortgage, or lease). It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a transfer of property, however: horizontal privity exists in easements that benefits both parties (i.e., where two adjoining landowners have a road that runs between their properties, touching both parcels of land).Horizontal privity would also exist among tenants in common who execute and record an agreement related to their property interests.    Even if the parcels the nephews inherited were originally part of one piece of land owned by the uncle, he devised them as separate parcels. In this instance, a covenant not to cut down the trees (a burden, since it is a promise to refrain from doing something) would still not constitute horizontal privity: their agreement would still be one that was merely mutually beneficial to each another as neighbors and only enforceable against one another.

That said, if you can nail down this rule and spot it on the exam, that gives you an easy point that other students may miss. A ""wild deed"" is any instrument (deed, mortgage, easement, etc.) that is recorded in the right office, but in a way that subsequent purchasers will not be able to find in a typical search of the title index. This puts the deed outside the ""chain of title.""     Most jurisdictions use a grantor-grantee index system for recording deeds. In these systems, when a purchaser wants to search the ""chain of title"" for property they are purchasing, they begin by searching the grantee index for the seller's name. This is to identify when the current seller received the property, and who he received it from. Then they keep following those breadcrumbs, finding the name of each grantor in the grantee index to make sure that no grantor ever claim to transfer property that they had never received. Then, the grantors are searched as grantors to verify that each grantor only transferred the property once, and that there are no ""branches"" in the chain of title that could lead to a competing claim.     Wild deeds generally arise when a grantee records a deed that they received from a grantor who, for whatever reason, was never named in the grantee index. This usually happens when the grantor failed to record their own deed. Let's look at an example:     O sells Blackacre to A on January 1, but A does not record. This means that A will not appear in the grantee index as a grantee of Blackacre at that time. Then, A sells Blackacre to B on February 1, and B records. This means that B will be in the grantee index and A will be in the grantor index on February 1. Then, O conveys Blackacre to C on March 1, who has no notice of the earlier conveyances to A or B. C searches the grantee index for O's name and learns that O has good title. C will also check the grantor index for O's name at any time before March 1, but since A never recorded her deed, O will not appear there. C would have no reason to search the grantor index for A's name, so won't see B's wild deed. Finally, on April 1, A records the deed from O to A. C conveys Blackacre to D on May 1. Now we see why B's deed is essentially lost. D will search the grantee index for C, and will find that C received Blackacre from O on March 1st. D will then search for O in the grantee index before that date to confirm that O had good title. So far, so good. Then, D will look for O and C in the grantor index to confirm that (1) O didn't convey Blackacre before conveying it to C on March 1, and (2) C did not convey it to anyone else between March 1 and May 1. Because D will only be looking for O in the grantor index before March 1, and A recorded on April 1, D will not find that deed. That means D will never know to search the grantor index to see if A ever conveyed the property to anyone, and will never find B' properly recorded deed.     I hope this helps!

Under Rule 59(a), a court may grant a new trial based on newly discovered evidence that existed at the time of the trial that was excusably overlooked and would have altered the outcome of the trial. A party only has 28 days to file this motion.   So, if the evidence comes to light in time to file a motion within a strictly limited 28-day period from the entry of judgment, the party may seek a new trial under Rule 59(a).

The life estate holder only has an interest in possession of the property for a period of time. Therefore, the life estate holder is only responsible for paying the interest because it represents a payment in exchange for possession of the property over time (the time to pay off a mortgage over a period of years).   By contrast, the future interest holder has an interest in the full value of the property, to be realized at a later date. The future interest holder is responsible for the principal payments because they will eventually receive the full benefit of the principal value of the property. If the life estate holder had to pay for the principal as well as the interest, neither they, nor their heirs, would ever receive the benefit of the value of the property.

It is my theory that the knock and announce rule is perpetually confusing for law students because it is a rule where, if it is broken, generally nothing happens.

Your ""open and notorious"" language sounds like you may be talking about acquiring an easement by prescription, which is analogous to acquiring property by adverse possession.

You could discuss negligence per se, but the sample answer notes that speed limits are established for ideal road and driving conditions, not hazardous weather conditions. Also, compliance with a statute does not mean, as a matter of law, a person cannot be found negligent.

They key difference is one is repayment for a debt. In 7326, the aficionado had a reasonable and honest belief that the bicycle in question was his bicycle. Consequently, he did not have the specific intent to take the personal property of another and therefore did not commit larceny. In 7741, we are dealing with a repayment of debt. If a defendant takes property with the honest belief that she is entitled to the property as repayment of a debt (i.e., a claim of right), then the taking does not constitute larceny. However, most states hold that debt collection is not a justification for what would otherwise amount to robbery. A ""claim of right"" is a narrow concept that is typically used in the context of repayment of a debt. If a person takes property with the honest belief that it is repayment of a debt that is owed to them, then they can use that as a defense to larceny. However, most jurisdictions draw the line there. If a defendant uses force or a threat of force to collect a debt, the claim of right is simply not available as a defense for the subsequent robbery charge. This rule is a matter of public policy because states do not want people to use force to collect on monetary debts.   Hope this helps!

Once the defendant puts their character in issue by having a witness testify as to the opinion of the defendant or the defendant's reputation, the prosecution may rebut in the following manner: Cross-Examination The prosecution may test the character witness by cross-examination regarding the basis for his opinion or knowledge of the reputation he has testified about. In most jurisdictions, one is allowed to inquire on cross-examination whether the reputation witness has heard of or knows particular instances of the defendant's misconduct pertinent to the trait in question. Note that if the witness denies knowledge of these specific instances of conduct, the prosecutor may not prove them by extrinsic evidence. he is limited to inquiry on cross-examination. Testimony of Other Witnesses as to Defendant's Bad Reputation The prosecution may rebut the defendant's character evidence by calling qualified witnesses to testify to the defendant's bar reputation or their opinion of the defendant's character for the particular trait involved. Here the defendant then takes the stand. So this is a new other witness, so the prosecution can only ask about reputation or opinion. If the prosecution had as the ""character witness"" on cross, they could have asked if that witness knew of or heard of particular instances. Now, the defendant does not &ldquo;open the door&rdquo; to character evidence merely by taking the stand, but as a witness, the defendant is subject to impeachment. Generally, a defendant's own testimony is not permissible as character evidence through opinion or reputation testimony, so this situation where a testifying defendant ""opens the door"" does not occur. Nevertheless, a defendant cannot be cross-examined about specific instances of conduct generally. However, when a defendant's bad act is not being used to show the defendant's criminal propensity but is being used for another purpose (i.e., MIMIC evidence), such instances of conduct may be admissible for that purpose.

Most jurisdictions define conscious presence as the testator being conscious of where the witnesses were and what they were doing when they signed. Under the conscious-presence test, the testator must be able to sense the presence or actions of another but need not actually be able to see the witness. Phone calls and Zoom won't suffice, though.  For example:Georgia signs her will while lying in a hospital bed. A vinyl screen separates her from the doorway where the witnesses are standing, which is 12 feet away. A nurse takes the will around the screen to the witnesses where they sign. Since Georgia was conscious of where the witnesses were and of what they were doing, the witnesses signed in her presence even though they were not in her line of sight.  Under the line of sight test, a person is present only if she could have seen the signing. (There is an exception for blind people). So, if a witness signs from his office, while the testator signs in her home, the attestation requirements are not satisfied. This does not mean that the signing must actually have been observed, but only that the person was in such close proximity that she could have seen the signing had she looked. Again, phone calls and Zoom won't work.  Steve    Ty Zhang @ 2022-07-14 20:58:48 wrote:  I'm confused about the extent of the conscious presence test.

Enforcement of a real covenant is more stringent than that of an equitable servitude. Enforcement of either require: it be in writing, intent, touch and concern, and notice.

This all centers around the theory of accomplice liability. Under the modern and MPC approach, an accomplice is a person who, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, aids or abets a principal prior to or during the commission of a crime. And an accomplice is liable to the same extent as the principal.    Here, the bank teller (i.e., the principal) committed larceny when he took and carried away the personal property of the supervisor with the intent to deprive the supervisor of that property. And the colleague aided and abetted by transferring the money into the car. This made him an accomplice. As an accomplice, he was guilty to the same extent as the bank teller. Thus, he is guilty of larceny. I hope this clarifies!

His withdrawal from the conspiracy was not effective because it occurred after the overt act.  However, by getting to the point where he became an accomplice, we have to consider if he can avoid liability for the larceny itself on an accomplice theory. If an accomplice aids or abets the crime, but seeks to withdraw before it is completed, then they have to (i) repudiate aid, (ii) do all in their power to countermand their prior assistance, and (iii) do this before the chain of events leading to the completed crime is unstoppable. See section (d) on page 9 of your MBE Crim Law outline. Because the man, at best, only did the first of those things, his withdrawal as an accomplice is ineffective and he will still be guilty of the completed larceny.

The collateral-order doctrine is intended to be used in a narrow scope of claims that are too important to be denied review and too independent from the cause of action itself to require deferment until a final judgment has been made. Decisions involving immunity and double jeopardy are the primary candidates for use of the collateral-order doctrine, but orders involving payment of attorney&rsquo;s fees, payment of costs of discovery devices like depositions, and payment of costs for noticing members of a class can be challenged using the collateral-order doctrine. Typically, the collateral order doctrine is only applied when a party is ordered to do something or pay for something.    Personal jurisdiction, venue, waiver of privilege, and discoverability or admissibility of evidence are not collateral issues &ndash; they cannot be decided without considering the underlying claim, and therefore are subject to the final judgment rule.

If a Criminal Defendant has been Questioned And Confessed After the 6th Amendment Right to Counsel has attached, I consider whether there has been an effective waiver of that right. If not, there has been a violation of the Sixth Amendment. If there has been a waiver, I would look to see whether there was a custodial interrogation. If so, and there were no Miranda warnings, there would still be a violation of the 5th Amendment.  I would advise you to review the relevant portions of the Outline to determine whether your statements of law are correct. See Large Outline at 26-33. I would point out one piece of this that I think is particularly significant on p. 33 of Large Outline:  Even after Sixth Amendment rights attach, the police may initiate non-custodial interactions with  the accused outside the presence of his lawyer, and there will be no presumption  that any knowing waiver of the right to have counsel present for the interaction is  involuntary.

The facts state the following:  The loan agreement, which was signed by the company&rsquo;s owner, provided that, to secure the company&rsquo;s obligation to repay the loan, the company granted the bank a security interest in &ldquo;all personal property&rdquo; owned by the company. Also that day, under an oral agreement with the company&rsquo;s owner (who had full authority to speak on behalf of the company), the bank took possession of one of the most valuable items of the company&rsquo;s property&mdash;an original Edison gramophone that the company had acquired because it was the earliest precursor of the company&rsquo;s digital music players&mdash;as part of the collateral for the loan. The bank properly filed a financing statement in the appropriate filing office, listing the company as debtor and, in the space for the indication of collateral, listing only &ldquo;all personal property.&rdquo;  So the security agreement used the super-generic term -- and that is not permissible. See page 9 of the full MEE outline:  A description of the Article 9 type of collateral (e.g., &ldquo;all of debtor&rsquo;s equipment&rdquo; or &ldquo;debtor&rsquo;s entire inventory&rdquo;) [in the security agreement] is usually sufficient unless the collateral is consumer goods or a commercial tort claim, but a super-generic description of collateral as &ldquo;all the debtor&rsquo;s assets&rdquo; or &ldquo;all the debtor&rsquo;s personal property&rdquo; is not sufficient.

Given that, why would the first set of photos be admissible?    I realize that the woman collected the evidence without direction from the police, so it's not excludable under the 4th amendment. But isn't it still excludable because it was collected in violation of a federal statute?"	"Dena Ray (Ed)"

Substantive due process can still apply even when EPC might also apply, though.  Choice B is hard to get at because in order to apply EPC strict scrutiny on a fundamental right, you've got to have the classification -- the two groups of people treated differently -- implicate the fundamental right directly. Here, you don't have that because the two classes are ""persons who are felons"" and ""persons who are not."" There's no fundamental right for felons to live together, and ""felons who have family who are also felons"" and ""felons who do not have family that are also felons"" isn't a distinction that the law is making.

To you second question, the disparate treatment between the two classifications has to directly impact the fundamental right. There's no fundamental right to live with other felons.

The recording act is essentially thrown out here because Daughter isn't a buyer. But she wins under the common law rule of first to have legal title to the property.     In this fact pattern we know that Daughter has been given a gift (she did not pay value), and Purchaser paid value for the property. We have also been given a notice statute. Now let's look at the rules: Only a grantee who pays value for an interest in real property is entitled to protection under the recording statutes. Grantees who acquire title of property by gift, intestacy, or devise are not protected by the recording act against prior claims, even those who fail to record their claims to the same property.     Therefore, when looking at Daughter's interest, she did not pay value, so she is not entitled to protection under the recording statute. Thus, we look at her interest under the common-law rule. This is why you need to analyze both the common law (which will apply to the gift if the recording statute does not), and the recording statute (as it is mentioned in the fact pattern). Accordingly, the recording act would not apply to Daughter generally, regardless of the type of recording act. Further, a bona fide purchaser is someone who purchases land for value and without notice that another individual has prior claim to the land.     Here, Purchaser can be held to have had constructive notice only for prior conveyances that were properly recorded. Railroad and Daughter recorded their interests but Sam, from whom they received the conveyances, did not record. The state records under a grantor-grantee indexing system, as indicated in the essay. Here, a ""wild deed"" is present (i.e., deed not within the chain of title) because Sam did not record the deed. Therefore, Purchaser had no constructive notice and could prevail over Railroad and Daughter's interests.     However, going a step further, it is unlikely that Purchaser would prevail because there exists a strong argument that he had inquiry notice. Had Purchaser viewed the property and performed a reasonable investigation, he would have seen railroad tracks left by Railroad, which would have put him on notice to inquire as to whom owned the property prior. Thus, Purchaser is not a bona fide purchaser; the easement is not terminated. If there were no inquiry notice, the easement would likely be terminated without constructive notice (the wild deed is still the issue).     I hope this helps!

It is a stronger defense that the offer was revoked because someone else accepted it and the museum was aware of this. So, the museum knew the offer was no longer available when it tried to accept. You can't learn that an offer is unavailable, attempt to accept anyway, and then sue when you can't accept, unless you specifically paid to have the option irrevocable. Because the offer was not a firm offer or made irrevocable with consideration, the man was free to revoke and accept another offer- the man did nothing wrong. This line of reasoning is stronger than the man attempting to say that because the museum didn't give him any consideration to keep the offer open, he didn't have to. Even if he didn't receive consideration to keep the option open, and it was just a plain revocable offer, he still would have had to actually revoke the offer to the other museum. In other words, this defense doesn't go far enough, because just saying that he didn't have to keep the offer open doesn't make it ok that he does not now accept the museum's offer. The revocation is what makes it- the offer was effectively revoked when he accepted the library's offer, and the museum was made aware.   I hope this makes sense!

You are using very technical terms. So I am not sure I entirely follow what you mean. But if partner 1 dissociates, that dissolves the at will partnership. During wind-up, the partners (including any properly dissociated partner) must agree to continue the partnership if they want it to continue. So if partner 1 wrongfully dissociated, 2 and 3 could vote to continue the partnership without her. If partner 1 properly dissociated, she would need to agree to the continuation without her.

A spendthrift trust expressly restricts the beneficiary’s power to voluntarily or involuntarily transfer his equitable interest. The spendthrift restriction applies only as long as the property remains in the trust, and it is inapplicable after it has been paid out to the beneficiary.I'm struggling to follow what exactly a creditor can access without a spendthrift restriction.

You are right that there isn't much practical effect. In a regular discretionary trust, the creditors can attach the beneficiary's interest at the trust level. If the trustee doesn't exercise her discretion to pay, there isn't much they can do.  In a spendthrift trust, the creditors can only attach at the beneficiary level. So if the beneficiary is paid, then they can try to catch her and attach what she was paid.  Hope this helps.

A spendthrift trust expressly restricts the beneficiary&rsquo;s power to voluntarily or involuntarily transfer his equitable interest. The spendthrift restriction applies only as long as the property remains in the trust, and it is inapplicable after it has been paid out to the beneficiary.    I'm struggling to follow what exactly a creditor can access without a spendthrift restriction. What does it mean that the creditors have the same rights as the beneficiary?

Let me know if the Question ID is incorrect. For now, I will tackle assault as a felony with regard to burglary.  The distinction between felony and misdemeanor generally is defined as afelony being a crime punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year; while a misdemeanor is a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or less or by a fine or by both. BARRK crimes are felonies that traditionally were considered inherently dangerous. While a BARRK crime would be sufficient for burglary the proper use of the categorization is for felony murder. Burglary is typically going to cast a wider net on what crimes will be sufficient as many states have broadened the scope of the crimes intended to be committed to include misdemeanors, like assault. Whether or not the crime being committed is actually a felony is rarely the focus of the bar question. They tend to focus/test more on when the intent to commit the felony arose or some other prong, like in this question (not an unlawful breaking).

I can't tell you which type of question this is because I don't know, but it is consistent with questions you may see on the upcoming exam.  2.Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide committed with criminal negligence (recklessness under the MPC) or while engaged in an unlawful act. The facts here state that the man had recently stopped taking his medication that was intended to control recurrences of seizures. He chose to drive despite not taking the medication. If he had taken the medication or followed his course of treatment, then his conduct would not have been considered reckless and criminally negligent. As stated at the end of the explanation for this question, the negligent act was driving the car after failing to take his medication. While the man's act of driving into the brick wall was performed while experiencing a seizure, and thus was not volitional and does not satisfy the actus reus requirement, the man's act of driving the car while knowingly suffering from the condition is considered a sufficient actus reus.

So while the defendant can impeach the witness with the journal at the time that he sought to introduce it as evidence, it cannot be admitted into evidence as a recorded recollection because no foundation for its admissibility has been established.

This just means that you have to sue both the partnership and the partner. Ajudgment against a partnership cannot be satisfied directly from a partner's assets, only from the partnership's assets. However, partners are not protected from personal liability for the partnership's obligations, no matter who is named in the judgment. See Partnerships Outline, I.A.3.a. A partner is jointly and severally liable for all partnership obligations. See Partnerships Outline, I.C.3.a. A judgement against the partnership is a partnership obligation, so the partners are jointly and severally liable for this liability. But because the judgment is not a judgment against the partners individually, a plaintiff cannot immediately bring the judgment against the partners to obtain their private funds or a lien on their personal property. Instead, the plaintiff will likely need to exhaust the partnership's assets before bringing a separate claim against the partners. The partners are still on the hook for these liabilities. It just remains to be seen how that liability will be enforced (e.g., separate action by plaintiff or contribution claim from partnership).   Hope this helps.

Sam conveyed as a gift to Daughter who did record. Since Daughter received as a gift, she is not a BFP and therefore even though she recorded she will not be protected by the recording statutes against PRIOR grantee, but at this point in the hypo, she is the owner of the land. Then we have O convey to Purchaser. At first glance Purchaser looks like a BFP. But is she?  BFPs take without notice (actual, constructive or inquiry). So while it is true is that Purchaser gave valuable consideration, we need to determine his purchase had notice. While no one has a legal duty to perform a title search, a subsequent purchaser will be charged with the notice that such a search would provide, whether or not they actually searched.  The issue is whether Purchaser would have had notice of the deed that Daughter recorded. The fact that a deed has been recorded does not always mean that a purchaser will be charged with notice of it. A subsequent purchaser will be held to have record notice only if the deed in question is recorded ""in the chain of title,"" which means that it is recorded in a fashion that a searcher could reasonably find it. In this hypo we have an example of a ""wild deed."" A ""wild deed"" in a recorded deed that is not connected to the chain of title. It does not give constructive notice because the subsequent bona fide purchaser cannot feasibly find it. We have this because Sam failed to record. Therefore the link back to O is not present! So she doesn't have constructive notice, next we look to see if she has inquiry notice!  A grantee has inquiry notice if a reasonable investigation would have disclosed the existence of prior claims. In the majority of states quitclaim deeds are not charged with inquiry notice from the mere fact that a quitclaim deed was used. If Purchaser had done a reasonable investigation she would have seen the tracks on the land and discovered the easement. If a recorded instrument (here the easement) makes reference to an unrecorded transaction (here the O to Sam transaction) the grantee is bound to make inquiry to discover the nature and character of the unrecorded transaction. So Purchaser had notice and thus Purchaser is not a BPF. Therefore, neither Daughter nor Purchaser can use that nice recording statute that the hypo gave us. Thus we are left we each having to rely on common ""first in time.""  I hope this helps!

Here, the &ldquo;shopkeeper&rdquo; in question is a vendor who is in the business of selling microchips. While a tradeshow is not a typical place where actual purchases are directly made, the item that was taken was a product that the vendor sells, which would make the actions of the entrepreneur (had then been true) shoplifting. Therefore, the shopkeeper&rsquo;s privilege applies.    A hotdog vendor is a shopkeeper, even if he does not have a physical shop in which to sell his goods. However, a private person selling items out of their personal garage is unlikely to have shopkeeper&rsquo;s privilege because state statutes usually require some kind of &ldquo;commercial establishment&rdquo;, like a business or a store or a vendor cart, to qualify larceny as shoplifting.

When a criminal defendant is trying to introduce evidence of his good character, he can only do so through opinion or reputation evidence, not through specific instances of conduct. An exception to this rule is that when character is an essential element of the crime charged, then the defendant may introduce evidence of his good character through specific acts. It's rare that character is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense. A way to conceptualize this is by asking yourself whether character is an element that must be proved in order to convict a criminal defendant, win a civil claim, or successfully argue a defense? Among the few instances where courts agree that character is an essential element are the character of a driver in an action for negligent entrustment of an automobile, the character of a party in a suit for defamation, a criminal defendant's predisposition to commit a crime after he/she has asserted an entrapment defense, and the character of an employee in a negligent hiring cause of action.

United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 274&ndash;275 (1980). There is no Sixth Amendment violation, however, if the police place an informant in the defendant's cell simply to listen and report the defendant's statements, without questioning the defendant. Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436, 456 (1986). Here, the police then placed the man in a holding cell in the police station with an undercover police officer who was posing as a man arrested for drunken driving. The undercover officer asked the man several questions in an attempt to elicit information about the crime and discover where the man's accomplices might be hiding. So, because the police intentionally placed the informant in the cell to create a situation likely to induce the defendant into making incriminating statements, then there was a sixth amendment violation. If the informant was placed in the cell to simply listen and report what is said, then there would be no violation. As for the fifth amendment, Miranda warnings are not required if the suspect being questioned is not aware that the interrogator is a police officer. Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292, 294 (1990). Example: The police placed an undercover officer, posing as a criminal, in the defendant&rsquo;s jail cell, and the undercover officer engaged the defendant in a conversation designed to elicit details of the crime for which the defendant was suspected. Such statements were admissible in the absence of Miranda warnings. Illinois v. Perkins, supra.  I hope this clarifies!  Lindsey    Gabriela Heizer @ 2022-07-07 17:56:04 wrote:  Hi.

Here, the woman cannot be charged with larceny because she did not have the requisite intent at the time of the initial taking. Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive that person of the property. Under the ""continuing trespass"" rule, if a person takes property without the owner's consent, but with no intent to permanently deprive, larceny may be committed at a later time if the intent to steal is later formed. However, the original taking must have been wrongful. The initial taking occurred when the woman picked up the box from the street. At the time that she picked it up, she did not have the intent to steal, but planned to return the box to the owner as was required by law. Due to the fact that she did not have the intent to steal the box at the time of the initial taking, she cannot be charged with larceny. So, for larceny, you have to have a wrongful taking that occurs at the same time as the necessary intent to permanently deprive. If someone takes property wrongfully, but without the intent to permanently deprive (for example, if someone takes a car just to go for a joyride, intending to return it), that wouldn't be larceny. But if they later decide that they really like the car, and form the intent to permanently deprive, then the continuing trespass rule provides for the previously-wrongful taking to be ""occurring"" at the time they now develop the intent to permanently deprive, and larceny has been committed. But if the initial taking was not wrongful -- as is the case here, since the person intended to return the lost property -- then the continuing trespass rule does not apply. Instead, it would (potentially) be embezzlement.  Hope this helps!

Generally, for a sale of goods, an acceptance that contains additional or different terms with respect to the terms in the offer is nevertheless treated as an acceptance rather than a rejection and a counteroffer. While the retailer rejected the additional term, this would not be considered a rejection of the original offer. So the terms of the original offer would still be enforceable.     Whether the additional or different terms are treated as part of the contract depends on whether the parties are merchants. When the contract is for the sale of goods between nonmerchants or between a merchant and a nonmerchant, a definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or written confirmation that is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance of the original offer. The additional terms are treated as a proposal for addition to the contract that must be separately accepted by the offeror to become a part of the contract. In this fact pattern, the contract was between a merchant and a nonmerchant. Since the retailer rejected the additional term, it did not become enforceable under the contract.

Here, the police placed the man in a holding cell in the police station with an undercover police officer who was posing as a man arrested for drunken driving.

It does not take on the citizenship of other states where the corporation has physical presence. The example I like to use to illustrate is that, let's say, a corporation has a 10-person headquarters in Connecticut, and is incorporated in Delaware. Only 10 people, but it's the C-suite (CEO, CFO, COO, etc.) where all decisions are ultimately made. But the business of that corporation is operating retail stores in downtown New York City -- let's say literally thousands of people work for this company in downtown New York. That corporation's main physical presence is certainly in New York, but it is not a citizen of New York. It is only a citizen of Connecticut (PPOB -- the nerve center) and Delaware (state of incorporation). In this fact pattern, that is State B for both incorporation and PPOB.  Hope this helps!

The first thing we must consider is the call of the question in 10038 and in 9894. In 10038, the call of the question asks, ""Assuming that the state statute is consistent with federal statutes regulating the financial services industry, is it constitutional?"" However, in 9894, the call of the question here states that the group sought a declaratory judgment that the regulation violated the Dormant Commerce Clause. Therefore, the scope of 9894 is much narrower than 10038. So when analyzing 10038, you must consider all constitutional violations as contemplated by the provided answer choices&mdash;not just the Dormant Commerce Clause.    Congress has exclusive authority over interstate commerce. The statute mentioned in 10038 permitted any regulation if it was consistent with federal statutes regulating the industry. Here, Congress permitted the state to enact any law regarding the regulation and taxation of persons in the financial services industry. Because Congress has exclusive authority over interstate commerce, it may explicitly permit states to act in ways that would otherwise violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. But because this deals with state taxation of commerce, we must consider whether it violates other constitutional provisions. In section VII.B.1.b.&mdash; Violation of other constitutional provisions of the MBE Constitutional Law outline, it states that "" A discriminatory tax on out-of-state businesses, even if authorized by Congress and therefore allowed under the Commerce Clause, may still violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, if it cannot satisfy the rational basis test."" So, in 10038, although the state tax on the out-of-state financial services industry would be permissible under the dormant commerce clause, it is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause because promotion of domestic business by discriminating against nonresident competitors is not a legitimate state purpose.    But 9894 deals with prohibiting out-of-state recreational hunters from hunting elk within the state. Because Congress permitted states to act in ways that would otherwise violate the Dormant Commerce Clause, this provision was constitutional. So, while the courts ruled on a state department's regulation, holding it invalid, Congress, which has authority over interstate commerce can create a law allowing what was deemed in violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause. Note that the call of the question here states that the group sought a declaratory judgment that the regulation violated the Dormant Commerce Clause. So, this question only dealt with the dormant commerce clause&mdash;not whether it violated one's rights under the Equal Protection clause. I hope this helps!

United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 274&ndash;275 (1980). There is no Sixth Amendment violation, however, if the police place an informant in the defendant's cell simply to listen and report the defendant's statements, without questioning the defendant. Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436, 456 (1986). Here, the police placed the man in a holding cell in the police station with an undercover police officer who was posing as a man arrested for drunken driving. The undercover officer asked the man several questions in an attempt to elicit information about the crime and discover where the man's accomplices might be hiding. So, because the police intentionally placed the informant in the cell to create a situation likely to induce the defendant into making incriminating statements, then there was a sixth amendment violation. If the informant was placed in the cell to simply listen and report what is said, then there would be no violation. As for the fifth amendment, Miranda warnings are not required if the suspect being questioned is not aware that the interrogator is a police officer. Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292, 294 (1990). The 5th Amendment/Miranda rules only apply for custodial interrogation. If there is no warning given and the informant is only listening and not questioning, then there is no 5th Amendment/Miranda violation. Also, Miranda warnings are not required if the suspect being questioned is not aware that the interrogator is a police officer. Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292, 294 (1990). Example: The police placed an undercover officer, posing as a criminal, in the defendant&rsquo;s jail cell, and the undercover officer engaged the defendant in a conversation designed to elicit details of the crime for which the defendant was suspected. Such statements were admissible in the absence of Miranda warnings. Illinois v. Perkins, supra.  I hope this clarifies!

The parties agreed to modify the original contract (to include the mold removal for an additional $2k), but the homeowner is now seeking to avoid the modification. So, the key here is that the homeowner is not seeking to void the contract. He is merely trying to avoid paying the modification to the contract. Therefore, we need to find an answer that focuses on the enforceability of the modification. Because the homeowner agreed to the modification, and there is consideration for it, the modification is enforceable. The homeowner could have refused, and then if the contractor refused to continue with the contract, he would be in breach and the homeowner could sue.  I hope this helps!

If the facts were different, there could be a fruit of a poisonous tree argument if the girlfriend was charged with the stabbing.

If the police searched the home and seized not only the knife, but also a computer, and while searching the computer, they found a list of people that helped the girlfriend commit crimes.

However, this is the MBE and it is not the best answer provided and so it would still be incorrect for the purposes of the exam. The question asks for the best way to challenge the method of electing the local school board. As the explanation states, substantive due process relates more to the situation where the government tries to take this right away from a specific individual through a quasi-judicial or adjudicatory proceeding. If, on a question, a fundamental right is being infringed upon for all persons, the issue is likely one of substantive due process. If the right is being denied to only a particular class of persons, then equal protection is in play. The question at issue deals with the latter. Furthermore, while property ownership is generally not a valid ground upon which to restrict the right to vote, there are situational exceptions to this rule (e.g. special purpose entities). However, the Equal Protection Clause generally requires the application of strict scrutiny to a restriction of voting to a particular class of persons, which generally results in the invalidation of the restriction.

Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995) (overruling application of the intermediate standard to federal discrimination). For a governmental affirmative action program based on race to survive, the relevant governmental entity must show more than a history of societal discrimination. The government&mdash;whether federal, state, or local&mdash;must itself be guilty of specific past discrimination against the group it is seeking to favor, and the remedy must be narrowly tailored to end that discrimination and eliminate its effects. In other words, the elimination of past discrimination in a particular governmental institution is a compelling state interest; attempting to remedy general societal injustice through affirmative action is not. In this question, the state agency created the rule to help redress the historical discrimination against these groups in the state and to help them achieve economic parity with other groups in society. Because this isn&rsquo;t saying that the rule was created to address the State's own specific history of racial discrimination, it doesn&rsquo;t survive strict scrutiny. Note that it states that there was a history of discrimination against these groups in the State, but it doesn&rsquo;t say that the State had a specific history of racial discrimination against these groups. For this rule to survive strict scrutiny, the facts would have to say that the State had a specific history of racial discrimination, and the rule&rsquo;s purpose was to help remedy that specific history &ndash; there would need to be direct evidence of the State&rsquo;s specific discrimination against these groups.

Personal jurisdiction analysis begins with a two-prong test: Is the exercise of personal jurisdiction statutorily authorized (this is typically, but not always, a long-arm statute); and Is the exercise of jurisdiction in this case constitutionally permissible (i.e. does it comport with due process -- ""traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice."") A long-arm statute is a statute that says that jurisdiction may be exercised whenever it is constitutionally permissible. In this case, the analysis collapses into, basically, just the second item. When it comes to the second item, there are certain bases on which -- based on history -- exercise of jurisdiction definitely comports with due process. These are the voluntary presence, consent, etc. bases. If, however, the defendant is served with process outside of the state, then you have to look at the defendant's contacts with the forum state to determine if jurisdiction is appropriate. General and specific jurisdiction are two methods of analyzing contacts. General jurisdiction requires systematic and continuous contacts that render the defendant ""at home"" in the forum state, such that it would satisfy traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice for any lawsuit to be maintained against the defendant. Specific jurisdiction requires only that there be minimum contacts with the forum state, which, due to being related to the subject matter of the litigation, it comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice to allow this particular litigation to be maintained. The claim must either arise from the activity within the state or the defendant must be essentially at home in the forum state for a claim that does not arise from the particular contacts to be maintained against them. So, the federal court could have personal jurisdiction under general jurisdiction or specific jurisdiction over an out of state defendant.  I hope this helps!

With this analysis it is important to identify who is being sued, where that person (or entity) is being sued, and under what law that person is being sued. Under the Eleventh Amendment, a state (or an official thereof) cannot be sued in federal court solely for a violation of state law.    Here, there is a legal representative of a person living in a mental facility. The facility is owned and operated by the state. There is a state law requiring the person running the facility (a state official) to provide the ""least-restrictive-environment"" possible for the people in the facility. The representative sued the official in federal court to enforce a state law. Because this is prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment, the federal judge should grant the official's motion.    Had the representative sued the official in federal court to enforce a federal statute (or prevent the enforcement of a state statute that violated federal law), then it is likely that the official could have been sued for injunctive relief. Additionally, if the representative had sued the official in state court to enforce the state law, then it also would have been all right.    If you would like some more information, &sect; I.A.3 of the Themis MBE Constitutional outline goes into some more nuances.    I hope this helps!    Amy G.

That impeaches the witness's character testimony -- if they answer yes, then you could ask ""So why, if they were in a fight, do you think they're peaceful?"" Or if they say they don't know about it, then you've impeached them by attacking whether they have enough knowledge to have an accurate opinion on the subject. But in this question, the question isn't directed at the witness. It's directed at the defendant.

Race, ethnicity, national origin are considered suspect and therefore require closer judicial examination.  In some cases--if the classification is by state law, for example, alienage is included as a suspect class.  Classifications based on status as a lawful resident of the United States (as opposedto a citizen) are subject to a variety of different standards, depending on the level ofgovernment and the nature of the classification.  The Court will generally apply the strict scrutiny test and strike down state laws that discriminate against aliens, such as laws prohibiting aliens from owning land, obtaining commercial fishing licenses, or being eligible for welfare benefits or civil service jobs.  BUT, undocumented aliens are not a suspect classification, even if it is a state law, because SCOTUS said ""their presence in this country in violation of federal law is not a 'constitutional irrelevancy.'""   Nevertheless, depriving them of education is not rationally related to asubstantial goal of the state.  So, include alienage as suspect for state laws, not federal, and only if it is based on lawful alienage.

To attain this status a person must satisfy three requirements (i) be a purchaser (ii) take without notice and (iii) pay valuable consideration. The notice discussion is there to determine if the buyer is a BFP and thus can use to the statue to prevail. A ""wild deed"" is a recorded deed that is not connected to the chain of title. It does not give constructive notice because the subsequent BFP cannot feasibly find it. Therefore the fast food chain would be a BFP and then we would go to our race-notice statue to determine who has title.    Notice statutes protect SUBSEQUENT purchasers against PRIOR grantees. Thus a race notice statute would not help school (a prior grantee) against fast-food (a subsequent purchaser).  I hope this helps!

In 9535, the question is asking whether the court had jurisdiction to hear the case. Now with regard to the rule stated in 9454, a citizen of the same state or a different state may sue an appropriate state official in federal court for prospective relief of an equitable nature. That includes injunctive relief. However, the federal court cannot entertain an action against a state government officer for violating state law. So, the exception applies only to federal law, not state law. Here, she is suing the official in federal court based on a violation of state law. She is not claiming that the injunction is needed for a violation of federal law. This is why this exception does not apply to this fact pattern. So, the 11th amendment prohibits the action of a federal court when the basis for the action is a violation of state law. In 9535, a citizen is filing an action against the attorney general seeking an injunction to prevent the attorney general from enforcing the state statute and the citizen is claiming that the law is unconstitutional. However, we don&rsquo;t know on what basis the citizen is claiming the law is constitutional (probably because the eleventh amendment issue isn&rsquo;t being tested here). So, as stated above, when a state official, rather than the state itself, is named as the defendant in an action brought in federal court, the state official may be enjoined from enforcing a state law that violates federal law or may be compelled to act in accord with federal law despite state law to the contrary. Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). Thus, if the citizen is claiming that the state law violated federal law, then attorney general may be enjoined from enforcing it. If not, then the person needs to file in state court.  I hope this helps!  Lindsey    Danny Dvorak @ 2022-06-29 15:29:30 wrote:  Hello,    I am having a bit of difficulty squaring question 9535 with the explanation in 9454.

Offenses requiring no mens rea are generally disfavored, and courts have held that there must be some clear indication of legislative intent to dispense with the mens rea element of a crime.

Regulatory offenses are more likely to be strict liability offenses, such as firearms regulations, traffic offenses, and food or drug regulations.

Under spousal immunity, the general rule is that the spouse of a criminal defendant may not be called as a witness by the prosecution, nor may a married person be compelled to testify against his spouse in any criminal proceeding. In federal courts and in a majority of state courts, the witness spouse holds the privilege and may choose to testify but cannot be compelled to do so. However, under confidential marital communications, communication made between spouses while they were married is privileged if the communication was made in reliance on the sanctity of marriage. The majority view, which is followed by most federal courts, is that the privilege is held by both spouses. Here, the defendant cannot prevent his wife from testifying against him at all. The wife could testify about things she personally witnessed or has personal knowledge about, should she so choose, as she is the holder of the privilege under spousal immunity. However, she cannot testify as to the confidential communication the husband shared with her about her husband's former employer, as it was a communication shared between spouses while married (and this privilege extends beyond the termination of the marriage—though here, they were only separated).

So, ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact will affect criminal guilt only if it shows that the defendant did not have the state of mind required for the crime. Example: A, hunting in the woods, shoots at what he reasonably believes to be a deer. In fact, it is B, who is killed. A's mistake of fact establishes that he did not have the state of mind required for murder. Compare: A, hunting in the woods, shoots through the tress at a figure he believes is his enemy B, intending to kill him. In fact, the figure is C, who is killed. A is guilty for murdering C despite his mistake of fact as to C's identify, because A's mistake does not negate his intent to kill a person. In this question, the mistake of fact regarding the plants did not negate the daughter's state of mind. She still intended to kill her parents and took a substantial step toward doing so. As such, this mistake of fact would not negate her specific intent to kill her parents, so it would not be a defense to attempted murder here.  I hope this helps!

Administrative search warrants are issued so that a valid public interest can be upheld, or when there is evidence of a statutory or regulatory violation.   The type of plan this statement is referring to is an administrative search, and the government is making the plan. This includes government searches of gun shops, automobile junkyards, wiretapping, drug testing of railroad employees, inventory searches of items in protective custody, border searches, etc.  For a traditional search warrant, an officer must have more than reasonable suspicion that evidence of illegal conduct will be found before a court can issue a search warrant.  The standard is lower for an administrative search warrant. For example, the government may believe statutory violations are taking place (i.e., clerks are failing to check ID&rsquo;s for age limits at liquor stores). Or perhaps there is a valid public interest in searching airplane passengers before boarding planes, without any probable cause that a particular passenger has engaged in (or is conspiring to engage in) criminal activity during travel. As a result, an administrative search warrant could be issued based on the government&rsquo;s plan to search plane passengers based on a valid public interest.  If you haven&rsquo;t already, you may consider reading section I.C.4(g) of the Criminal Procedure Outline on administrative, special needs, and inventory searches. There are many good examples discussed and it may provide additional context for you.

Generally, when instructions like this are given it is because there is either a specific rule or regulation they want you to focus on without distraction or the question could potentially be too broad without narrowing it without instructions providing a focus.  If the question does not provide instructions like this then I would not ignore anything, state or federal, that may factor into your answer. That being said, especially with multiple choice questions, don&rsquo;t allow yourself to get to distracted by rabbit holes that you over-think your answer. Multiple choice questions are intended to be a short fact patter that allows them to narrow onto one topic to be tested on that question. If you feel like you are thinking too deeply step back and try to figure out what general legal topic is that being tested. It&rsquo;s not uncommon with the multiple-choice questions there are technically two answers that are correct you need to pick the one that is &ldquo;more correct&rdquo;.   This caution against over-thinking is especially relevant to topics you may have real-world experience with or extensive study (beyond the law-school classes). It&rsquo;s easy to see nuances or find threads in questions that may &ldquo;technically&rdquo; be correct, but end up leading you to a wrong answer. If this is the case for you on any of these topics, be mindful of this tendency and dial it back to what the question is asking that the typical recent law graduate may know.  With the essays, when you outline you answer you should plan to discuss or at least mention the things that relate to the question. Even if this is something that you will ultimately determine does not apply, mention it. If you don&rsquo;t mention it the graders don&rsquo;t know that it was considered and dismissed. They will have to assume you didn&rsquo;t remember it.  It&rsquo;s difficult to talk about these things in a general way, but I hope you get what I&rsquo;m saying.   I hope this helps.

Collateral estoppel is narrower than res judicata. Res judicata focuses on something relatively large - the scope of a ""cause of action."" If it applies, the result is usually to bar the claimant from asserting a second case. Collateral estoppel, in contrast, focuses on something relatively narrow - an issue that was litigated and determined in the first case, and that is relevant in a second case. With collateral estoppel, the issue is deemed established in the second case without need to proffer evidence on it. So you need to see if you are trying to get an entire case to go away so that there is no second case at all, or an issue to not have to be relitigated in a second case.  I hope this helps!

As with the Fifth Amendment right to counsel, the defendant must make a specific, unambiguous statement asserting his desire to remain silent. So, these two rights are separate. If a suspect makes an ambiguous statement regarding the right to counsel, the police are not required to end the interrogation or to ask questions or clarify whether the suspect wants to invoke the right. Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452 (1994). However, once that right to counsel is invoked, all interrogation must stop until counsel is present. Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477, 484 (1981). If the suspect voluntarily initiates communication with the police after invoking his right to counsel, a statement made by the suspect, such as a statement that the suspect spontaneously blurts out, can be admissible because it is not made in response to interrogation. In addition, police may re-open interrogation of a suspect who has asserted his Fifth Amendment right to counsel if there has been a 14-day or more break in custody (such as the release back into the general prison population of a suspect who has been incarcerated for another crime). In such circumstances, the officers must give fresh Miranda warnings and get a valid waiver before beginning questioning. Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U.S. 98 (2010). If a defendant invokes his Miranda right to remain silent, the interrogator(s) must &ldquo;scrupulously honor&rdquo; that request (e.g., immediately cease interrogation, allow for a significant passage of time, give a second set of warnings). However, if after the defendant is released from custody, the defendant indicates a desire to speak to police, then a subsequent interrogation would be lawful, as long as the defendant was not coerced. The defendant must again receive fresh Miranda warnings.  I hope this helps!

It's always been true that the examiners give a 6-month to 1-year grade period, but they actually affirmatively announced that this would be the case this summer, due to the significance of these rulings. You can find that announcement here.  I also wouldn't, at this time, worry too much about Whole Woman's Health v Jackson. I think it's going to take practitioners, legal experts, and judges some time to suss out all the implications here and I don't think the examiners would ask examinees to do it. On the exam, if you see this issue at all, I imagine it will involve a straightforward case of a state official acting in an executive (not judicial) capacity.  As for religion, it's often mentioned alongside other suspect classes and is considered to be a suspect class (e.g. Griffin v Illinois, Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. Ford, New Orleans v Drake) but there hasn't really been a decision on those grounds. Cases involving religion usually arise under the First Amendment and are analyzed that way. And really, the cases are going to arise under either the Free Exercise or Establishment clauses. The government would either be infringing on the Free Exercise clause by singling out some kind of behavior, or Establishment by favoring one religion over another, or religion over nonreligion. But given the state of flux of the Establishment Clause after today's ruling, it would be nice to have a straightforward strict scrutiny analysis to fall back on! And, I wonder if that's the future of the issue. But for now, it's safe to stick to analyzing cases that involve religion under the First Amendment.  I hope this is helpful!

This is not your typical defeasible life estate. It is an usual example. The owner here devised her residence to the companion ""for life or until she vacates the premises, and then to my nephew."" This means that the companion received a defeasible life estate and the nephew received two future interests in the residence&mdash;a vested remainder -- based on the ""until she vacates language""-- and an executory interest -- based on the ""for life"" language. It is just strange phrasing that you don't often see in practice questions. The conveyance says ""for life or until she vacates the premises."" That creates two possible events with different consequences for each, which means two different interests for the nephew. They won't conflict because one of those events would happen first. Either she vacates the premises or she dies. Whichever happens first controls.  Hope this helps.  Steve    Israel Del Mundo @ 2022-06-23 17:55:26 wrote:  The question ID number is 9633. Thank you!

As a very broad policy consideration, the 5th Amendment protection against self-incrimination is concerned with police intimidation and coercion. Over time, this has evolved to require that police provide Miranda warnings before a custodial interrogation, unless an exception to Miranda applies.    In question 9574, the gang member was certainly in custody and he was also subject to &ldquo;interrogation&rdquo; because the officer&rsquo;s comments were likely to elicit an incriminating response. However, the undercover police exception applies, so Miranda warnings were not required. See the MBE Criminal Procedure Outline, Section II.B.3. Exceptions to the Miranda Requirement.    That makes sense considering the main policy consideration: the gang member was not being intimidated or coerced into a confession by police officers exerting their authority because he didn&rsquo;t even know that he was speaking to an officer.     BUT, note that the analysis is different under the 6th Amendment right to counsel. Once the right to counsel is triggered (not seen in question 9574), the police cannot set up this same scenario to try to elicit statements. See the MBE Crim Pro Outline, Section III.C.4. Admissibility of a Defendant's Statements to Informants.    I hope that helps!

Artificial entities such as corporations, partnerships, and labor unions may not assert the privilege, but a sole proprietorship may. The privilege does not extend to the custodian of corporate records (or a corporate officer), even if production would incriminate the custodian individually. Here, the grand jury is investigating a corporation for tax fraud (not the COO), and a subpoena was served on the COO, who acted as the custodian of the corporate records. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that production of these records might implicate the COO in criminal misconduct, as the custodian of the corporate records, the COO must produce them. The privilege protects only testimonial evidence. Nontestimonial physical evidence (such as a blood or urine sample, Breathalyzer test result, handwriting exemplar, voice sample, or other evidence of physical characteristics) is not protected. The privilege generally does not apply to an individual&rsquo;s voluntarily prepared business papers or to records required by law to be kept, such as tax returns. Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976). So, it would depend on the nature of the document.  I hope this helps!

Unlike with the 5th Amendment Right to Counsel, the 6th is offense specific. This means that simply reading the Miranda warnings to the defendant and obtaining a waiver are not sufficient to protect his interests. Since we are at a ""critical stage"" in the prosecution, counsel must be present. However, presence of counsel is required when asking about the ""critical stage"" crime; here that would be the arson. Since the defendant is not on trial for the theft, that crime is not a critical stage, therefore presence of counsel is not required. Now, two crimes committed in one criminal transaction are deemed to be the same offense for Sixth Amendment purposes unless each offense requires proof of an element that the other does not. If a defendant's conduct may be prosecuted as two or more crimes, then the Blockburger test is applied to determine whether the crimes constitute the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. Here, arson and theft are different crimes, therefore inquiry into the theft does not impact the defendant's 6th Amendment Rights concerning the arson case. In this case then, the statement is admissible against the defendant even though counsel was not present. If this right applied to this interrogation, even the act of reading the defendant his Miranda rights and requesting a waiver (without his counsel present) would have violated that Sixth Amendment right since it had already attached.

To begin with, you&rsquo;re correct that neighbors can enter into agreements regarding the use of their land. That agreement between neighbors can only be enforced between the two neighbors as a real covenant (suit for damages) or an equitable servitude (injunction). For the agreement between the neighbors to be enforced upon subsequent property owners, there are several requirements.   Horizontal privity is a requirement that applies to a burden (not a benefit) that runs with the land. In the example question, horizontal privity must apply to the rancher&rsquo;s burden of maintaining the small road constructed on the property line.   For horizontal privity to exist, the original two neighbors who enter into an agreement (i.e., a real covenant or equitable servitude) must have privity of estate at the time the agreement was made. This means that there must be some shared property interest at the time the agreement is made. See Real Property Outline VI.B.5(a) &ndash; Horizontal privity.   Sometimes the shared property interest will be the sale of a piece of land from one party to another with an agreement that the land be used (or not used) in an agreed upon manner. This situation might be what you saw in the previous question you mentioned, where a parcel of land was subdivided. For both parties to have a shared property interest at the time the agreement was made, the agreement would need to be made at the time of a sale. If one party sells a piece of land to another, and then they agree to a real covenant, the parties didn&rsquo;t have a shared property interest at the time the agreement was made, thus horizontal privity wouldn&rsquo;t exist.   Here, both parties owned a portion of land where the road was built. The neighbors shared a property interest in the land where the road was built, at the time the agreement was made. Therefore, they had privity of estate at the time the agreement was made, and horizontal privity exists.   I hope this helps!  -Krista    Vikram Rajan @ 2022-06-21 14:02:16 wrote:  Looking at my outlines and thinking back to the memory of another problem I got wrong, I thought that horizontal privity required that the real covenant be established at the time that a parcel of land is subdivided.

(1) The accord is the new agreement, but it does not discharge the original agreement. It only suspends the right to enforce the original contract until the accord is satisfied (or breached). (2) The satisfaction is the performance of the accord agreement. Satisfaction of the accord agreement, discharges both the original contract and the accord contract. If, however, the accord is not satisfied, the non-breaching party may sue under either the original un-discharged agreement or for breach of the accord agreement (but obviously the non-breaching party cannot recover under both agreements; the plaintiff must choose one). An accord is conditional. If it is not satisfied, the original contract is not discharged. An ordinary contract modification (i.e. substituted agreement), on the other hand, is not conditional. A modification replaces the original agreement with a new agreement. If the new agreement is not satisfied, the non-breaching party may only sue under the new, modified contract (the original contract does not exist anymore). So just remember that in an accord and satisfaction, the later agreement is conditional (i.e. ""if you do X, I will forget about the original contract""). Promising to do something else is not sufficient for excuse of performance by accord and satisfaction. The party must actually do it in order to discharge the original agreement. Another key is to remember with an accord and satisfaction is that there must be a dispute as to the amount owed. This is why the facts clearly state, ""I know that you owe me $20,000..."" and the other party agreed this was a good deal. There was no dispute, they just separately agreed to modify the contract. Also, the designer is seeking a solid commitment that will bind to the new performance, rather than opening either one up. They're not presenting it as an option between the two -- they want a commitment to this new performance now, so that they won't worry about raising the money elsewhere.  I hope this helps!

When evaluating a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court should not weigh the evidence at all. If the plaintiff is able to produce a single shred of evidence that would support all the elements of the claim being present -- even if that evidence is ""meager"" -- then the court must let the jury decide.

Because the prima facie elements are established, that's enough. The case should go to the jury. If the plaintiff just forgets to introduce evidence on a particular element, that's when JMOL is appropriate -- e.g. if a plaintiff were to forget to introduce any evidence as to damages in a negligence claim, then JMOL would be appropriate.

Title is a legal interest (ownership) in something. Sometimes it can be evidenced by a physical document (like a deed), but it is not actually a document. If you purchase a tube of toothpaste, title (legal ownership) passes from the store to you. Now you have title over that tube of toothpaste, there is no physical document involved. If a friend buys a new blender and says to you ""here, you can have my old blender"", then her title over that blender passes to you. If you break into her house and steal her blender, all you've done is obtain possession of the blender, and not title, because you do not have a legal interest in that blender- it still belongs to your friend, and title is still with her. Try looking at it from the victim's point of view: What does the victim think is the nature of the transaction? There are no bright-line rules, but it can help to compare larceny by trick to false pretenses. For example, if I come up to your door and say that I'm a jewelry cleaner and trick you into giving me your expensive jewelry and promise to come back the next day with your super clean jewelry and then never come back, that is larceny by trick. Note that I stole your jewelry, but I didn't snatch it off your hand, or break and enter to get it, etc. I tricked you into handing it over. Since at this point the title of the jewelry isn't being passed- you believe you are still the owner and that I'm just doing an overnight clean, but I do have possession, that is what makes it larceny by trick instead of larceny by false pretenses (title must pass for false pretenses). Here's another example: Say D fraudulently induces V to give her money in payment for a laptop which D represents that she owns but is really owned by X, that is false pretenses because V is giving up title to property (her cash) in reliance on a false representation of material fact by D. Now try this one - D obtains V's car on the representation that she will return it in an hour. This is larceny by trick because no title passed from V to D. If, however, D obtains V's car by giving her a bad check for the purchase price, that is false pretenses. Title has transferred from V to D.  I hope this helps!

Therefore, the intervening criminal act would not be unforeseeable and break the chain of causation in this situation.

Like most legal questions, the answer will depend on the facts presented. The issue in question 7346 is whether the written agreement between the farmer and the woodlands owner is enforceable by the farmer&rsquo;s son against the subsequent owner--the developer--even though the farmer failed to record.  Easements that are not recorded are subject to extinguishment by recording acts unless it is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the dominant estate, it relates to an underground utility, or (if race-notice or notice jurisdiction), the easement discoverable by reasonable inspection or inquiry.   Real covenants that burden the land will be subject to applicable recording acts, as well.  As the explanation notes, the agreement created a profit &agrave; prendre&mdash;a non-possessory right to enter the land of another rand remove natural resources. Profits are analyzed like express easements; since the profit was granted but not recorded, then the recording act governs whether or not it is enforceable against subsequent owners.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter what jurisdiction governs Question 7346, because the farmer failed to record. The developer recorded his deed without notice of the profit, therefore the developer&rsquo;s interest shouldn&rsquo;t be encumbered by the profit.   Note that the question makes it clear that the developer had no notice about the profit (&ldquo;Neither the deed nor the owner of the woodlands mentioned the agreement with the farmer&rdquo;). Notice can be constructive (recorded) OR actual (just knowledge that the agreement exists). Had the woodlands owner actually told the developer about the profit, then in a notice or race-notice jurisdiction, the developer would have taken the property with notice about the encumbrance. (Then, however, the question would become whether or not the son would be able to enforce his interest, which turns on whether the interest was profit in gross (personal to the farmer) or profit appurtenant (tied to the land)).

In Wickard v. Filburn the farmer argued that his 23 acres of wheat, grown primarily for personal use (and the rest sold in state), wouldn't have substantial impact on interstate commerce. The court said that such impact could be presumed, based on the prospects of allowing farmers in general to grow as much wheat as they liked. In other words, you don't need to get an economist expert witness in every case to defend the idea that economic activity will have substantial impact on interstate commerce, it's a inference that is presumed.

If it was a residential lease, the landlord would have that duty. Thus, even if the elements for a constructive eviction was present, since the landlord had no duty to make the repairs, the tenant will not succeed in a constructive eviction claim. This is becausewe would still need to prove that the landlord had a duty to fix whatever was interfering with the Plaintiff's possession or enjoyment of the leased property.

""if the P has not been wholly compensated, it is now the usual rule that a release of one tortfeasor does not release the others but instead diminishes the claim against the others, ordinarily by the amount of compensation received from the released tortfeasor."" What is a release and/or release agreement? How does it work? A release is a surrender of plaintiff&rsquo;s cause of action against the party to whom the release is given. As you noted, generally a release of one tortfeasor does not discharge other tortfeasors unless expressly provided in the release agreement. Rather, the claim against the others is reduced to the extent of the amount of consideration paid. Let's say that you are in a car accident and you sue three other drivers who hit you, A, B, and C. You think there are $1 million in damages owed to you in total. You settle with A for $100,000 and grant him a release as part of the settlement. The other two go to court against you and lose. The jury finds $1 million in total damages -- that would be reduced by the $100,000 you already received from A.    2. ""Under strict products liability, each supplier has a right of indemnification against all previous suppliers in a distribution chain."" I'm having trouble understanding. Can you provide an example to illustrate this concept?Each supplier of a defective product, when strict liability rules apply, is liable to an injured customer, but each supplier has a right of indemnification against all previous suppliers in the distribution chain. Let's say, for example, that you buy a defective product at Walmart. You sue Walmart and win on the basis of strict liability. Walmart can implead or later go after its supplier of the defective product to be reimbursed (indemnified) for what it had to pay you. That supplier could implead or later go after the manufacturer of the defective product to be reimbursed (indemnified) for what it had to pay the supplier.

A child, in contrast, is generally not assumed to be able to comprehend warnings. That's one of the criteria of an attractive nuisance -- see item (ii) in section (d) on page 23 of your MBE Torts outline. So the duty is different, and it's a duty to use reasonable care to protect children from harm. The questionthere is only whether reasonable care was used, and putting up a fence that a child could not get over or around would be reasonable care, which satisfies the duty.  In the adult case, reasonable care isn't the only requirement -- there's also a duty to warn, which wasn't sufficiently done because there was no indication of the electrical wires.

You are correct that because the family-purpose doctrine applies in many jurisdictions that it should be considered when choosing an MBE answer choice. However, because it is not the majority rule, it should only be the correct answer when the question indicates the doctrine might be at issue (e.g., the question might say that the jurisdiction follows the family-purpose doctrine).  Here, the question does not indicate which rule is followed. Consequently, the majority rule is applied.  Under the majority rule for negligent entrustment, the owner of a vehicle may be liable for the driver's negligence if the owner knew or should have known of the driver's negligent propensities. Here, the teenager had never been negligent on the road, been ticketed, nor had he fallen asleep at the wheel. Therefore, his parents had no knowledge nor reason to know that the teenager would fall asleep while driving and are not liable for negligent entrustment.  If you would like some more information, &sect; IV.H.4 of the Themis MBE Torts outline goes into some more nuances.  I hope this helps!  Amy G.

Under strict liability, causation is generally decisive to the defendant&rsquo;s liability even without wrongful behavior and regardless of fault. Causation is not eliminated, but depending on the circumstances it is &ldquo;assumed&rdquo;. There still needs to be a correlation that concludes &ldquo;the plaintiff would not have been injured but for the defendant&rsquo;s conduct&rdquo;.   This correlation needs to be a proximate cause versus a remote cause. In general, this means the tort must be along the lines of the &ldquo;expected&rdquo; damage within the classification of that strict liability. I may be liable if my livestock escapes and eats my neighbor&rsquo;s crops (actions animals could be expected to do), but I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be liable for a cow attack on a human (something unexpected). Or someone who engages in abnormally dangerous activity is strictly liable for damage that comes within the risk that makes that activity dangerous. Or a product manufacturer/seller is liable for a defective product, but not if the client has used it in an abnormal manner.  There is reluctant to impose strict liability when there result is too remote or there is an intervening cause. All of these scenarios can throw the burden back onto the plaintiff instead of putting the assumption of liability on the defendant.  The courts also look at knowledge or foreseeability. A defendant&rsquo;s horse has a bite history but kicked the plaintiff. Plaintiff would need to show a known propensity to kick, not just attack  There are any number of other examples and &ldquo;slippery slope&rdquo; scenarios that could be examined here, but the general answer is that no elements of negligence are eliminated through strict liability, but they can make them &ldquo;assumed&rdquo; depending on the specific circumstances of the damage.  I hope this makes sense.  Kelley     Jonathan Rosenthal @ 2022-06-13 20:04:14 wrote:  REALLY basic questions: Does a plaintiff under a strict liability theory need to prove causation?

In question 7463, the applicable statute is a race jurisdiction&mdash;first to record wins.   Though the bank&rsquo;s mortgage was a PMM, this is not the reason why the bank has priority. The priority attached to a PMM (whether or not it has been recorded) is only with respect to mortgages and liens against the mortgagor that predate the acquisition of the property. The uncle&rsquo;s interest was acquired after the bank&rsquo;s mortgage. The bank failed to record; the uncle properly recorded. So, in a race jurisdiction, if the uncle was a BFP, then the uncle should win.  HOWEVER, the reason why the bank wins (why choice D is the correct answer) is that a mortgage is considered to be &ldquo;paid value&rdquo; only if it is given simultaneously with the loan. The uncle&rsquo;s mortgage was granted several months after the loan was given to the buyer---so he would not be protected by the recording act, because he would not be considered a BFP. Therefore, first in time, first in right governs, and the bank would win.  Hope this helps!

Thereafter, the person who received the benefit promises to pay. The promise is enforceable under the material benefit rule even if past consideration is considered as no consideration. So, the typical scenario arises when one party does something for another, the second party promises to pay after the fact. Under common law, the contract would not be enforced, because there is no consideration. However, under the material benefit rule, the first party is entitled to recover only the extent necessary to prevent injustice. If someone does something for someone as a gift, the material benefit rule does not apply.

When a defendant is unjustly enriched by the plaintiff, restitution generally allows the plaintiff to recover on the benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant, rather than on the harm suffered by the plaintiff. Here, no benefit has been conferred, and thus the car restorer cannot recover the value of his service. Answer choice B is incorrect. Although the duties of both parties were discharged, this fact alone would not bar the car restorer&rsquo;s recovery in quasi-contract for the work performed. Therefore, answer choice A is the better answer.""    I do not understand this answer choice and explanation based on the doctrine of impossibility. Answer choice A states that no benefit was conferred, but a benefit was conferred and destroyed at no fault of the car restorer. So, I thought that would make his recovery impossible because the benefit was destroyed. And, if he could recover then it would be under a quasi-contract since he did substantially perform, but that was not an answer choice. Can you please explain how since no benefit was conferred due to destruction the car restorer can recover under a quasi-contract theory?    With gratitude,    Tresina"	"Lindsey Hallam"

Courts enforce an equitable servitude not as an in personam right against the owner of the servient tenement, but as an equitable property interest in the land itself.

X promises Y, for herself, her heirs, successors, and assigns, that X'sparcel will never be used for other than residential purposes. Y records theagreement. X sells her property to Z. The burden created by this promise wouldnot run at law as a negative covenant because horizontal privity is missing.However, under an equitable servitude theory, the burden will run, and an injunction will issue against other than residential uses. Now imagine the same facts, but X transfers only a life estate to Z. Again, the burden would not run at law because of the absence of vertical privity. The burden would, however, be enforceable as an equitable servitude.

If the joint tenancy remains unsevered at a joint tenant's death (which is what 3b is noting), the right of survivorship also remains intact. At the moment of the death of one of the joint tenants, the property passes to the other joint tenant(s) immediately through the right of survivorship. Here, as soon as the husband passed away, his interest in the building was immediately transferred to the wife, who now owns it in its entirety. Because the lease was an agreement with the husband and tenant, and the husband no longer has an interest in the property, the lease is no longer valid and is terminated. The tenant would have to create a new lease with the wife because she is now the only one with a property interest in the building. Had the husband survived his wife, the tenant's lease would not have terminated but would have been effective for the full 10-year period, even if the husband had subsequently died or sold the property. The same consequences would have transpired had the husband mortgaged his joint tenancy interest, since, for part 3, it was presumed that a mortgage (like a lease) did not sever the joint tenancy. When concerning a tenancy in common, the tenant here does retain the same property rights as the husband but only for the term of the lease. When the husband dies, his ownership will pass to the proper heirs directed by will or intestacy. Although the ownership passes, the lease still remains valid for the lease term.  I hope this helps!

However, the answer explanation and the lecture reviewing the questions seems to construe the statute very broadly suggesting that it contemplates all car accidents and drivers involved in any accident with a texting driver.  I see why the contributory negligence claim fails since the texting driver didn't contribute to himself being rear ended, but I was confused when reading the explanation about answer choice A.

I&rsquo;ve answered both of your questions below:  1) A typical race-notice statue only protects a subsequent purchaser who lacks notice and records first. You&rsquo;ll see words like &ldquo;without notice, who shall first record&rdquo;   The statute in Essay 2205 reads, &ldquo;No conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value and without notice unless the same (meaning, the deed/mortgage of the proior conveyance) be recorded by law."" This a notice statute, because it does not require the subsequent BFP to record to in order to take priority over an earlier transaction.   2) Ademption could be discussed in two contexts: 1) when one of the contracting parties to a land sales contract dies before closing (see Real Property Outline &sect; III.D.4). OR 2) when discussing the failure of specific bequest in a will because the property is missing or destroyed (see Real Property Outline &sect; IV.C.1.a and, for more in-depth information, Wills and Decedents Estates Outline &sect; V.F)   Neither of these are at issue in Essay 2205; Oscar sold the property to Sam over 40 years ago, and there is no indication in the facts that Oscar made a specific bequest of that land in his will.   Your time will be limited on the exam, so to maximize your points, make sure you focus your analysis on the major issues (easements, priority of interests, constructive notice, inquiry notice) that will allow you to determine what rights, if any, the Purchaser, Daughter, and Railroad have in the land.

If a modification to a senior mortgage would only increase the term of the mortgage, then this would not prejudice the junior interest.  But if a modification increases the total amount owed by the borrower to the senior mortgage (by increasing the principal or interest), the practical effect would be to decrease the value collateral available to satisfy the junior interest in a default. In this case, the subsequent modification by the senior interest (ie the additional loan amount) would not have priority over the junior interest.  Hope this helps!

Some courts hold that because the lessor's own right to possession would cease on her death, so must the right of any lessee (i.e., the lessor could not convey more than she had). Others hold that the lease operates as a ""temporary severance,"" and the remaining joint tenant's survivorship rights are therefore postponed until the end of the lease. The examiners adopt the first view here. So, at the moment of the death of one of the joint tenants, the property passes to the other joint tenant(s) immediately through the right of survivorship. Here, as soon as the husband passed away, his interest in the building was immediately transferred to the wife, who now owns it in its entirety. Because the lease was an agreement with the husband and tenant, and the husband no longer has an interest in the property, the lease is no longer valid and is terminated. The tenant would have to create a new lease with the wife because she is now the only one with a property interest in the building. Had the husband survived his wife, the tenant's lease would not have terminated but would have been effective for the full 10-year period, even if the husband had subsequently died or sold the property. The same consequences would have transpired had the husband mortgaged his joint tenancy interest, since, for part 3, it was presumed that a mortgage (like a lease) did not sever the joint tenancy. So, the rule that ""a transfer of the landlord holds the new landlord to the same obligations as stated in the lease"" does not apply in this case since the rule does not apply when the land is held by joint tenants with the right of survivorship in a jurisdiction where the lease does not sever the joint tenancy and the lessor joint tenant dies. That rule applies to tenants in common and in jurisdictions where a lease by one joint tenant severs the joint tenancy (and thus, turns it into a tenancy in common). There are also other rules where a lease survives or is terminated depending on the type of lease. A tenancy for years and a periodic tenancy survive even if the landlord dies while a tenancy at will ends once the landlord dies, unless the lease specifically states otherwise. However, the rules regarding the type the property is held/type of tenancy (ex: joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entirety) would always prevail over the rules on the type of lease (ex: tenancy for years, periodic tenancy or tenancy at will). So, here, because of the right of survivorship that accompanies a joint tenancy, when the husband's died, his interest in the property is automatically extinguished transferred to his wife as the surviving joint tenant. Since the wife's interest was not subject to the lease, she does not have to honor the lease he entered into without her consent and the lease is automatically terminated because the husband's interest was extinguished.  I hope this helps!  Lindsey    Sarah Flagel @ 2022-06-08 13:05:53 wrote:  Would you clarify the answer to the last question of essay 5322?

There is no hard and fast rule to dictate whether substantial performance has occurred. If the non-breaching party is not getting most of what they wanted out of the agreement, then there is not substantial performance. If a party has materially breached, he has not substantially performed. So, the overall principal is that the more the breach defeats the entire purpose of the contract and the expectations of the non-breaching party, the more likely it is to be considered material.

After default on the obligation, but prior to a foreclosure sale, the mortgagor may retain the property under the doctrine of equity of redemption by paying the amount of the loan obligation currently owed. In addition to being exercised by the mortgagor, the right of redemption may also be exercised by anyone whose right to mortgaged property stems from the mortgagor's interest in the property, such as a purchaser, as seen here. Therefore, the buyer would at least be able to redeem the property by paying the outstanding loan obligation owed and remaining in possession. However, this question illustrates the dangers in buying property subject to an outstanding mortgage--especially one in which the mortgagor is not personally liable for the debt.

You are correct that the chef's firm offer was irrevocable for a maximum of 90 days. However, this does not mean that the chef's offer was automatically revoked at the end of those 90 days. Rather, this means that the chef could revoke the offer after that time (it was no longer irrevocable). But, the chef did not revoke the offer. This, coupled with the fact that the chef said the offer applied to any order for ""this calendar year,"" means that the offer was still available at the end of November.

So let's say the facts are the same here (offer open until end of year), except that the chef attempts to revoke on day 80, and the other party attempts to accept on day 81. Now the firm offer rule comes into play, the revocation is invalid, a contract is formed. If the chef tries to revoke on day 91, and the offeree tries to order on day 92?

When the joint tenancy with right to survivorship was created, it met the requirements of the unity of possession, interest, time, and title. A joint tenant may only convey his/her own joint-tenancy interest without the other joint tenant's consent. Therefore, a conveyance by only one joint tenant will only affect and sever the unities as to that tenant's property interest. A severance of a joint tenancy does not automatically convert into a tenancy in common if there are more than two joint tenants. The severance of the youngest brother selling his share to the oldest brother did not affect the joint tenancy of all the brothers' shares. The only parcel that was affected was the parcel that was sold. The portion from the younger brother to the older brother was converted into a tenancy in common, but the original share of the older brother and the share of the middle brother remained a joint tenancy with right to survivorship. So, the recipient of that interest (the older brother) now possesses an interest in a tenancy in common, in addition to whatever other interest he had (in this case, a joint tenancy interest).

The reason this is an issue is because the right of survivorship means that the wife now owns the property outright.

Responses to your 3 questions are noted below. Hope this helps you. Steve ---------- 1. What are absolute deeds? I read the outline, but still don't understand their significance/purpose.It is a mortgage alternative that some try to use to avoid the lengthy procedures required for foreclosure with a regular mortgage. A landowner needing to raise money may ""sell"" the land to a person who will pay cash and may give the ""buyer"" an absolute deed rather than a mortgage. This may seem to be safer than a mortgage loan to the creditor and may seem to have tax advantages. However, if a court concludes, by clear and convincing evidence, that the deed was really given for security purposes, they will treat it as an ""equitable"" mortgage and require that the creditor foreclose it by judicial action, like any other mortgage. This result will be indicated by the following factors: the existence of a debt or promise of payment by the deed’s grantor; the grantee’s promise to return the land if the debt is paid; the fact that the amount advanced to the grantor/debtor was much lower than the value of the property; the degree of the grantor’s financial distress; and the parties’ prior negotiations. 2. ""When real property is sold and then leased back to the seller the transaction may constitute the creation of a security interest in the property, a disguised mortgage, rather than a sale-leaseback arrangement."" Why? This is another way people try to get around the system.A landowner needing to raise money may sell his land to another for cash and may then lease the land back for a long period of time. As in the case of the absolute deed, the grantor/lessee may attack such a transaction later as a disguised mortgage. Factors that will lead the court to such a result are: the fact that the regular rent payments on the lease are virtually identical to payments that would be due on a mortgage loan; the existence of an option to repurchase by the grantor/lessee; and the fact that the repurchase option could be exercised for much less than the probable value of the property at that time, so that the repurchase would be very likely to occur.   3.

It is a condition subsequent that ends the interest.A fee simple determinable islimited by specific durational language. This means it is a fee simple determinable if the grantor uses the words &ldquo;so long as,&rdquo; &ldquo;while,&rdquo; &ldquo;during,&rdquo; &ldquo;until&rdquo;.   In a fee simple determinable, the grantee's ownership over the property automatically terminates upon the happening of a stated event, and full ownership of the property is returned to the grantor or his successor in interest. Thus the grantor always has a possibility of reverter.  Yes, you are correct. In your example,A has a present interest in Whiteacre and if A stops using Whiteacre as a restaurant, it will automatically transfer to B.  Yes. It is a FSSEI (fee simple subject to executory interest).  The main difference of afee simple subject to executory interest and a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is who the property will vest upon the happening of the event. For thefee simple subject to executory interest, it vests on (transfers to) a third party while for the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, it vests on the grantor since it always includes the words ""right of re-entry/to re-enter"" or ""power to terminate"".  A fee simple subject to executory interest is an interest that will end upon the happening of some event and that future event will vest the property to a third party who is not the grantor. This means that that in order for it to be an executory interest, the happening of the condition/event cannot transfer and vest the property to the grantor. It should vest on a third party like your example.  Hope this helps!

Here, we only look at if the ""subsequent"" purchaser, the fast-food chain, had notice when it purchased the property and if it recorded first. In this case, the fast-food chain did not have notice of the recorded wild deed of the culinary school because it was not in the chain of title. The chef did not record the deed from the original owner to the chef, so there was a gap in the chain of title. When the chef conveyed the property to the culinary school, the culinary school recorded the deed but a person looking up the ownership of the property would not find the deed from the original owner to the chef. The deed from the chef to the culinary school is therefore a wild deed. The fast-food chain would have no knowledge of either the deed from the original owner to the chef or the deed from the chef to the culinary school (even though it was recorded). Further, the fast-food chain recorded its deed in the proper chain first. That is why the fast-food chain won. To protect the culinary school's interest, based on the race-notice jurisdiction here, the chef would have needed to record the deed, or the culinary school would have had to take actual possession of the property.

""Quiet enjoyment"" means no interference with a person's possession of property.  In deeds, however, there must be an express covenant of quiet enjoyment. General Warrantee deeds contain this express future covenant, that the grantee’s possession will not be interfered with by a third party’s lawful claim for title.  In both residential and commercial leases, there is a covenant of quiet enjoyment that is implied. The landlord will not interfere with the tenant's possession of the leased premises. There is also a duty under this implied covenant for the landlord to take action against a tenant's nuisance-like behavior  control common areas. It is breached only when the landlord (or someone with superior title) prevents tenant from possessing the premises. Real Property Outline § II.C.4 goes into detail what constitutes active eviction or constructive eviction.  Additionally, leases contain a warrantee of habitability that is also implied in most residential leases. This requires the landlord to maintain the property such that it is reasonably suitable for residential use. A condition that substantially threatens a tenant’s health or safety violates this warrantee. This warrantee cannot be waived by the tenant. Real Property Outline § II.C.3 explains this in much greater detail. I’m not quite sure what you are asking here—did you mean to ask about the implied warrantee of habitability? The lease in Question 2823 was a commercial lease, so do not consider a warrantee of habitability unless the facts tell you otherwise. 2. The covenant of quiet enjoyment in the facts is the same as the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in leases in your outline. It is only breached when someone disrupts the possession of the tenant. There can be actual eviction, or constructive eviction, but not every interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises amounts to a constructive eviction—temporary acts do not generally constitute constructive eviction. Tenant must give notice to landlord and adequate time to permit the landlord to fulfill his duty, and then the tenant must vacate the property in a reasonable time. See Real Property Outline § II.C.4.b.  Even though the tenant had specific needs for building temperature, it’s not likely that the A/C breakdown would constitute constructive eviction; there were repeated failures, but the building was only temporarily without A/C for 3 times (1st for 3 hours, 2nd for six hours, and 3rd for 10 hours) in five months. The tenant could have negotiated his specific A/C requirements with the landlord before signing the lease, but he failed to do so.  Hope this helps!

Yes. Remember, if the facts indicate a landlord-tenant issue, it is the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment (that the tenant can possess the property without interference by the landlord). To determine if there is actual or constructive eviction (and whether the tenant can withhold rent), the facts must show that the landlord breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.

Changes in the parties' circumstances after divorce are not considered once the award has been entered. A ruling on the merits of modification is different, though, from a question on jurisdiction to hear the case. Because 1(b) does not require an analysis of the merits of the husband's request (but only whether the court has authority to hear it- Civ Pro elements and fact that state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over domestic relations issues), the answer does not analyze the differences between spousal support and property division.

""Quiet enjoyment"" means no interference with a person's possession of property.   In deeds, however, there must be an express covenant of quiet enjoyment. General Warrantee deeds contain this express future covenant, that the grantee&rsquo;s possession will not be interfered with by a third party&rsquo;s lawful claim for title.   In both residential and commercial leases, there is a covenant of quiet enjoyment that is implied. The landlord will not interfere with the tenant's possession of the leased premises. There is also a duty under this implied covenant for the landlord to take action against a tenant's nuisance-like behavior  control common areas. It is breached only when the landlord (or someone with superior title) prevents tenant from possessing the premises. Real Property Outline &sect; II.C.4 goes into detail what constitutes active eviction or constructive eviction.   Additionally, leases contain a warrantee of habitability that is also implied in most residential leases. This requires the landlord to maintain the property such that it is reasonably suitable for residential use. A condition that substantially threatens a tenant&rsquo;s health or safety violates this warrantee. This warrantee cannot be waived by the tenant. Real Property Outline &sect; II.C.3 explains this in much greater detail.  I&rsquo;m not quite sure what you are asking here&mdash;did you mean to ask about the implied warrantee of habitability? The lease in Question 2823 was a commercial lease, so do not consider a warrantee of habitability unless the facts tell you otherwise.  2. The covenant of quiet enjoyment in the facts is the same as the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment in leases in your outline. It is only breached when someone disrupts the possession of the tenant. There can be actual eviction, or constructive eviction, but not every interference with the use and enjoyment of the premises amounts to a constructive eviction&mdash;temporary acts do not generally constitute constructive eviction. Tenant must give notice to landlord and adequate time to permit the landlord to fulfill his duty, and then the tenant must vacate the property in a reasonable time. See Real Property Outline &sect; II.C.4.b.   Even though the tenant had specific needs for building temperature, it&rsquo;s not likely that the A/C breakdown would constitute constructive eviction; there were repeated failures, but the building was only temporarily without A/C for 3 times (1st for 3 hours, 2nd for six hours, and 3rd for 10 hours) in five months. The tenant could have negotiated his specific A/C requirements with the landlord before signing the lease, but he failed to do so.   Hope this helps!

This is generally seen in a grantor-grantee, landlord-tenant, mortgagor-mortgagee relationship. There is not horizontal privity when two adjoining landowners merely make an agreement, unless there is a simultaneous grant of an interest (eg, adjoining landowners each granted to the other a right of access over his property for a road).     Vertical privity - This means there is an unbroken chain of ownership from the original parties, transferring the entirety of the interest of the covenanting party. There is not vertical privity if a covenanting party conveys a life estate interest in his property. The covenant cannot be enforced against the life tenant because a life tenant does not hold the entire FSA interest of the covenanting party.     Hope this helps.

I’ve answered your two questions separately: Question 1 – Defenses to annulment Family Law Outline § II.A discusses two types of relationships that can be annulled: a void marriage and a voidable marriage. Although the terminology is very similar, they are in fact two very distinct things.  A void marriage is treated as it has never happened. It will not be legally recognized for any purpose, and does not require judicial action to be dissolved. The three categories of void marriage are: prior existing marriage, incest, and mental incapacity. Family Law Outline § II.A.1.  If there is a void marriage (prior existing marriage, incest, or mental incapacity), the only way to defend against an annulment action is to deny the existence of the impediment. Family Law Outline § II.A.5. You can’t remove the impediment of incest (after all, blood relations are blood relations), so that’s set-in stone. The impediment of mental incapacitation is also unlikely to be removed. However, the impediment of a prior marriage could be removed simply by divorcing the spouse of the prior marriage. Removing the impediment simply moves the marriage to category of voidable marriage.  A voidable marriage is valid until one spouse seeks to legally void the marriage. There must be a judicial decree to dissolve the marriage. The grounds for a voidable marriage are age, impotence, intoxication, fraud/duress, and lack of intent to marry. Family Law Outline § II.A.2. Example: Adam marries Bethany. A few years later, he marries Cindy. Cindy does not know about Adam’s prior marriage and believes in good-faith that she entered into a legal marriage with Adam. Adam and Cindy’s marriage is void as a matter of law. Adam then divorces Bethany. The impediment of prior marriage is removed, so Adam and Cindy’s marriage would no longer be void as a matter of law. However, Adam and Cindy’s marriage then becomes voidable—valid only until one spouse seeks to legally void the marriage, based on the grounds listed above.  Question 2 – Children’s capacity to contract Family Law Outline § VI.D goes into detail about some of the special protections (and also limitations) the law imposes on children. For instance, while children can convey property, they cannot execute a valid will. Children are also treated differently in tort law  criminal law. A minor can enter into a legal contract, but because minors are deemed to lack the legal capacity to be held to contractual duties, courts generally will not enforce these contracts.  This does NOT mean that they are incapable of contracting: it simply means that any contract entered into by the minor is voidable at any time by the minor until the age of majority. However, the minor can still choose to hold the other party to the terms of the contract. See Contracts Outline § I.E.6.a. There are a few exceptions—if a minor contracts for necessities, and these necessities are supplied to the minor, the minor can’t just void the contract; they must pay (albeit an amount limited to the reasonable value) for the service or/good provided to them. See Contracts Outline § I.E.6.a.1. There are also some statutory exceptions: for example, an education loan made to a minor may be fully enforceable by the lender.

There are only three ways to end a marriage: death, divorce, and annulment. Divorce is the legal dissolution of a valid marriage. Annulment voids a marriage and declares it as having never been valid.  A void marriage is not a valid marriage. It is annulled as a matter of law&mdash;it is treated as though it never happened. You don&rsquo;t need file a judicial action to have it annulled.  A voidable marriage is considered a valid marriage until one spouse seeks to annul it, but there must be a judicial decree in order to do so. Grounds for a voidable marriage are age, impotence, intoxication, fraud/duress, lack of intent to marry. If a marriage is annulled, it is treated as though it never happened.   If grounds for annulment do not exist, the marriage cannot be annulled. Instead, the parties must file fordivorce in order to dissolve the marriage.  1)You asked, &ldquo;Does that mean all marriages are considered voidable?&rdquo;  No.If there are no grounds for annulment, the only way to dissolve the marriage is by divorce.   To have a marriage annulled, the party seeking annulment must have grounds to obtain the annulment.A voidable marriage is simply a marriage that can be annulled. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be annulled; voidable marriage are valid marriages unless and until one spouse seeks to void it. The parties may have grounds to annul the marriage but decide to remain married.  2) You asked, &ldquo;So, is ""marriage with removed impediment (prior marriage)"" also a ground for voidable marriage and should be included in the list?&rdquo;  No. The only grounds for annulment for a voidable marriage are age, intoxication, fraud/duress, and lack of intent.Family Law Outline &sect; II.A (pgs. 4-6) explains annulment and the grounds for annulment in detail:   a) Age: A party who is under the age of consent to marry and who did not seek the consent of his parents or the court may apply to have the marriage annulled. However, if the party who was not of legal age attains such age and continues to live with party as a married couple, many courts will prohibit the filing of a annulment based on age.     b) Impotence: A marriage is voidable if one party is &ldquo;naturally and incurably&rdquo; impotent, unless the other party knew about the condition before the marriage.    c) Intoxication: If either party was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of marriage, which made that party incapable of contracting into a marriage, then that marriage may be annulled. In most jurisdictions, however, the parties must be able to demonstrate that they did not ratify the marriage by continuing to voluntarily live with each other after the ceremony.    d) Fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, or force - the marriage was the result of a fraud that goes to the essence of a marriage. The fraud must be based on present facts. Most courts require that the parties immediately cease living together once the fraud is discovered.    e) Lack of intent: Most jurisdictions permit annulment when the parties participated in the marriage ceremony as an act of jest or hilarity and do not have the requisite intention to be bound by the act. This also includes cases in which the parties, in advance, agree to only some, but not all, of the conventional aspects of marriage, including sexual and emotional fidelity, economic interdependence, and commitment to the relationship. Often seen in cases with immigration issues, this type of marriage is commonly referred to as a &ldquo;limited purpose&rdquo; marriage.    I hope this helps clarify things for you!

For the offer to be irrevocable, there would need to be an option, which would require consideration, or a firm offer, which require the offeror be a merchant.

However, option contracts are available under both the common law and the UCC. Option contracts require consideration. If consideration is provided, the offer becomes irrevocable. If there is no consideration provided, then there is no option contract under the common law or the UCC, and the offer can be revoked at any time. Firm offers are available only under the UCC. Firm offers do not require consideration but do require (i) the offeror is a merchant, (ii) there is an assurance that the offer is to remain open, and (iii) the assurance is contained in a signed writing from the offeror. If these requirements are met, a merchant's offer is irrevocable for the time stated in the offer, or a period not to exceed 90 days. Again, firm offers are different than option contracts because firm offers do not require consideration. A merchant is someone who regularly deals in the type of goods involved in the transaction or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out has having knowledge or skill particular to the practices or goods involved in the transaction. It also includes any businessperson when the transaction is of a commercial nature. Here, a chemistry professor is selling an autographed first edition novel. She is not in the business of regularly dealing in autographed first edition novels; she's just an individual selling a book to a co-worker. Because the professor isn't a merchant, the UCC firm offer rule doesn't apply. And since the colleague did not provide consideration for the option, no option contract was formed.

There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with starting your response to question 2 by saying, &ldquo;If we assume that the agreement is not enforceable, then we must first determine which assets are subject to division by the divorce action as well as the factors the court should consider in the distribution of marital property.&rdquo; But you don&rsquo;t really have to do that&mdash;that is essentially restating the question.

In other words, the benefits of an easement must corresponddirectly to the use and enjoyment of the possessor of the dominant estate. This would be the opposite of an easement in gross, which is an easementgranted to benefit a particular person (as opposed to the land).Example: A owns lakefront property and grants B, who lives in a town across thelake, an easement to gain access to the lake at a certain point on A&rsquo;s property. Acreated an easement in gross because it benefits B, not any land owned by B.An affirmative easement simply means that the easement gives the holder the right to make affirmative use of another&rsquo;s property (e.g., the right to cross another&rsquo;s land to access a highway). Both an easement in gross and an appurtenant easement could be affirmative.  Hope this helps you.

Usually, it&rsquo;s tested in the context of example 57: I run a business on the side: Geis&rsquo;s Chainsaws. You send me a purchase order requesting a chainsaw for $400. On the back of this form is an indemnification provision saying &ldquo;seller agrees to indemnify buyer in the event of a lawsuit related to the chainsaw.&rdquo; I send back a confirming memo that has the opposite indemnity provision of the buyer&rsquo;s provision (purported acceptance to previous offer with different terms). That being said, the example that you reference is specifically testing the SOF, not 2-207. Sometimes there might be more than one rule that can apply to the lecture handout examples, but the examples don&rsquo;t discuss those other rules because it is only being used to illustrate one issue. Now, assuming 2-207 applies to this example, and also assuming both parties are merchants, when both parties are merchants, the courts in different jurisdictions disagree as to the result when different terms are included in the merchant offeree&rsquo;s acceptance. A few jurisdictions treat different terms the same as additional terms. Most, however, apply the &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; rule, under which different terms in the offer and acceptance nullify each other and are &ldquo;knocked out&rdquo; of the contract. When gaps are created after applying the knock-out rule, the court uses Article 2&rsquo;s gap-filling provisions to patch the holes. Since quantity is an essential term under the UCC, it cannot be knocked out and replaced by a gap filler. So the contract would fail for indefiniteness&mdash;the parties failed to agree to a quantity or a means to determine quantity.  I hope this clarifies!

In a tenancy in common, each joint tenant owns an equal share of the property, but there is no right of survivorship. Each tenant can unilaterally transfer, mortgage, or devise their interest in the property without affecting the interests of the other tenant. For example, if two tenants hold equal interest in a property in tenancy in common and one dies, the deceased&rsquo;s interest in the property is distributed per his will (or through intestate laws).    In a joint tenancy, the tenants have the right of survivorship. For example, if two tenants hold equal interest in a property in joint tenancy, if one of the tenant&rsquo;s dies, the deceased&rsquo;s interest in the property is terminated and automatically goes to the surviving tenant.

I noted that 750 ILCS 5/505 was noted for an example. That statute changed in 2016 when Illinois rewrote the entire Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act.

On a typical MPT, Franklin, Columbia, and Olympia are individual states with their own court systems. Franklin's courts include the District Court (the trial court), Court of Appeal, and Supreme Court. These states exist in the 15th Circuit, which is a federal system with its own court structure. In the MPT In Re Hammond, the dispute is occurring at the state level in front of a grand jury in Gordon County. The issue is a state issue, involving Franklin's own Rules of Professional Conduct and Evidence. Thus, the federal case U.S. v. Robb is merely persuasive. If the case was from the Supreme Court of Franklin, then it would be binding.  I hope this helps!

The prompt says the trucker promised to deliver the farming implement from the manufacturer to a farmer. The trucker fulfilled that promise, so he has not breached his promise. In other words, the trucker did not promise to deliver the implement to the farmer immediately after picking it up. Because the farmer was under no duty to immediately deliver the implement (was not under a duty that the condition; immediate delivery - occur), the non-occurrence of that condition was not a breach by the trucker. The manufacturer promised to pay the trucker if the trucker delivered the implement directly to the farmer after picking it up. This is a condition precedent on the manufacturer's performance. The trucker did not deliver the implement directly to the farmer after picking it up. Because the condition was not fulfilled, the manufacturer is excused from performing his side of the contract (paying for the delivery). So, his refusing to pay was also not a breach of contract. Even though the manufacturer was not aware of this fact, it excused the condition and so the manufacturer was not in breach.  I hope this helps!

For a single plaintiff vs. a single defendant in diversity: the plaintiff may aggregate all his claims against the defendant to reach the amount in controversy; (Example: Pat the Plaintiff brings an action against Dan the Defendant: $35,000 in breach of contract damages and $65,000 in personal injury damages for a car accident having nothing to do with the contract. Pat may aggregate the claims). Now, in your example, the plaintiff has a federal claim and two state law claims. So, jurisdiction would be based on federal question for the federal claim. The general rule is that when the basis of jurisdiction is a federal question, a party may not join a separate and distinct nonfederal claim that does not independently satisfy jurisdictional requirements, unless the nonfederal claim arose from a common nucleus of fact that would trigger supplemental jurisdiction. Under this principle, unrelated state-law claims would not be permitted to be joined in a federal question action unless they independently satisfy jurisdictional requirements; aggregation would only be permitted between diversity claims. So, the general rule is that federal question claims cannot be used to aggregate with unrelated state law claims -- the state law claims cannot be joined to a Federal question case unless those state law claims independently satisfy jurisdictional requirements. When the claims are related, then the state law claims can come in under supplemental.  I hope this helps!

A quasi-contract exists if: i) The plaintiff has conferred a measurable benefit on the defendant; ii) The plaintiff acted without gratuitous intent; and iii) It would be unfair to let the defendant retain the benefit because either (a) the defendant had an opportunity to decline the benefit but knowingly accepted it, or (b) the plaintiff had a reasonable excuse for not giving the defendant such opportunity (e.g., because of an emergency). It is a Quasi-Contract if looking at the actions of the party, the court can assume that the parties would have definitely entered into a contract had they had the opportunity to do so. The other party does not have to promise to pay for it to be enforceable. Example: A surgeon was on his way home when he saw a paragliding accident victim passed out by the side of the road with serious a leg injury. He performs emergency sutures and saves the life and the leg of the victim. The court would look at this and say that even if the doctor did not have a contract with the accident victim, any accident victim would have entered a contract with the doctor at the time of the accident so the doctor could save his life and leg. The Court will treat this is if a contract existed and require the victim to pay the reasonable value of the doctor's services even if there was no promise from the victim to pay the doctor to prevent unjust enrichment. For Moral Obligation plus subsequent promise, there is an actual promise by one party to pay for the benefit conferred on him. The performance of one person was already performed before the promise to pay was made and the promisee did not confer the benefit as a gift to the promisor. Therefore, the past performance is considered as past consideration and the promise to pay usually would not be binding. This is because under common law, a legal detriment that is incurred in the past does not constitute consideration since it was not bargained for and was not in exchange for a legal detriment in return. However, since the promise to pay was based on a moral obligation, this promise is enforceable. Example: Jared risked his life when he saved Alfred from falling off a cliff while on a hike. Alfred, who was very grateful, promises to pay him $2,000 because he saved his life. Alfred's promise to pay Jared $2,000 is enforceable even if it was made after he was already saved.
